            <p>
              D3.js is the de facto library for drawing data visualization on
              the web. Unless you are very intimately familiar with the API, you
              probably view it as a monolithic framework, and make charts by
              copy + pasting code from bl.ocks.
            </p>

            <p>
              In this extensive article, I talk about every individual D3.js
              module, and how they factor into your goals. Writing this article
              was really rewarding, since I got to delve into parts of the API
              that I had never looked at before. For example, the{' '}

                different geographic projections
              </a>{' '}
              and <a href='/blog/d3#drawing-svg-shapes'>polygon methods</a> will
              definitely come in handy in the future!

              This article is the first in a series, showing how to make your
              web charts interactive. It runs through two ways to add a tooltip
              to a histogram, while trying to show how to generalize this
              knowledge to create your own custom interactions.

              I love experimenting with taking advantage of the web to innovate
              on teaching. I experimented with ways to consistently keep the
              main code to the right of the article, which really helps keep
              changes in context.

              Having spent ten years teaching myself D3.js and designing
              dashboards and data visualizations, I wrote the book that I wish I

              While most books teach data visualization design <i>or</i>{' '}
              development <i>or</i> theory, my book combines all three while
              walking through practical examples. You'll create your first chart

              A weekend exploration of fishing in foreign waters - most of the

              Each circle is a unique profile of a country that illegally fishes
              in other, often poorer, countriesâ€™ waters. Data collected by
              Global Fishing Watch which used AIS tracking devices, among other
              data sources, to monitor commercial fishing activity and larger
              boats.

              After Umbel moved into its new office in the old Power Plant, we
              wanted to make a great first impression with our entrance screens.
              I wanted to build an interface that keeps visitors and employees
              informed about the weather, especially useful for planning the
              best bike ride home.
